VEXTRA
An Into the Breach Vek Mod By: Djinn, NamesAreHard, Tatu, and Hedera
v1.0.1

We've heard your cries for more Vek, and we've delivered. Introducing "Vextra", the largest Vek mod created to date. With a full team of 4 modders, we've added 5 new core Vek, 7 new unique Vek, 5 new psions, and a custom boss. With this, Vextra provides a new opportunity. Vextra can be merged with the vanilla Vek, but also provides the same variety as Vanilla did (pre-AE) and can be played standalone, for a fully unique experience.

Instructions for Use:
Modloader:
Modloader 2.8.3 or higher is highly recommended, but older releases may work on older versions (you should always take the highest version when possible) for the mod to run. Download the latest Modloader Here: https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-ModLoader/releases
Installing:
Once installing the modloader, extract "Vextra" into your mods folder located in your Into the Breach directory with the Breach.exe executable
Easy Edit:
Easy Edit is embeded into the modloader now, so make sure you have it on in the Mod Loader Extensions (it should tell you if you don't)
Using the Mod In Game:
This information was written out by hand while easyEdit was still becoming a thing. Read this wiki for in-depth information, or this snippet for simple information
https://github.com/itb-community/ITB-Easy-Edit/wiki/EasyEdit
This mod utilizes Easy Edit (by Lemonymous) to get the Vek in game. There's three main tabs you'll want to use located with the Mod Content Menu.
Enemy Lists Editor:
The enemy lists tab contains a list of enemy lists that can be put onto islands as their spawns. You can either create your own custom list, or use the lists we've provided: "Vextra Only" and "Vanilla + Vextra". It also contains the "Finale" list, read below for more info on the Finale.
Note: Hitting the "Default" button at the bottom is a good way to make sure everything is as it should be.
Boss Lists Editor:
The same as enemy lists but with bosses.
Island Editor:
The island editor contains all 4 islands with their enemy list, boss list, mission list, and structure list. For each island, change their enemy list and boss list to the list that you would like to play with, whether that be Vextra only or the combined list. Once you've done this for all 4 islands, you're set.
If done correctly, Vextra Vek should now show up in game. If it doesn't, double check the island editor, and if it still doesn't, feel free to @NamesAreHard or @Tatu on the Into the Breach Discord (assuming we're still active).
Finale:
Currently for the finale, you have to make it yourself. In the enemy list editor, there's a list named Finale. Drag any Vextra Vek you'd like to see in the finale into that list and your solid.


How to Report Bugs or Issues:
1. Add an Issue to the github, anyone can submit issues. Put your discord name in the post if it does not match with your github name. https://github.com/Tatuzudo/Vextra/issues
2. Report in the #Vextras Thread on the ItB Discord or @NamesAreHard and @Tatu in the #modding-discussion channel

Mantis- Attacks two diagonal tiles.
Silkworm- Shoots a projectile forward while webbing backwards.
Termites- Dashes through solid objects, leaving a rock in its place.
Unique:
Isopod- Launches itself as an artillery shot, dealing damage as it bounces backwards from its target till landing on empty ground.
Ice Crawler- Shoots an icy gas 3 tiles that does damage and freezes.
Dragonfly- Smoke the target, preparing to explode the smoke, dealing damage with fire outwards in a cone shape. If there's no smoke, it damages and lights the target on fire. Flies.
Antlion- Cracks the target, preparing to attack it and send the unit down a chasm. Burrows.
Cockroach- Shoots an artillery that self damages, but can revive at the end of the turn if it doesn't get damaged again or stepped on.
