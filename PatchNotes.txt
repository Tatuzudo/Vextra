Changes to Acid Psion
Fixed a bug where Vextra Bosses wouldn't show up on the fourth island in Unfair Mode

Version 1.0.1
Bug Fixes:
Fixed an issue where antlion would crack cracked ice, resulting in instant objective kills
Fixed an issue with the subzero achievement where it wouldn't trigger at the end of a mission
Fixed an issue with the reactive psion where you could move before it activated
Overhauled Mission Impossible Achievement
	Closing the game no longer invalidates the achievement
	It now checks the lists at the start of the game so if they are changed mid run it still works
	The achievement now tells you whether your current run is valid, and how many islands are complete
Fixed many cockroach bugs:
	Alpha and leader revive animation no longer plays in reverse
	Beta Cockroach no longer disappears in its tooltip
	Arachnoids properly spawn after resetting or quitting the game and then killing a cockroach
		We got no clue on that one
Blacklisted Popular Hero and Invulnerable on Secret Squad pilots now that we can do that
Optimized the isopod achievement to work more consistently
Fixed an issue where flying ants would cause a console error when spawning and could trigger the Dragonslayer achievement

Balance Changes:
Nerfed Stinkbug Leader so it's line of stink only goes out two tiles instead of infinitely
	This nerf also goes to the secret squad
Antlion Hp Core: 3 --> 2 Unique: 5 --> 4
Thunderbug got a small stat buff to help solidify its place in Unique
Nurse Psion can now be killed by friendly fire
Termites are now Core Enemies and Antlions are now Unique

Changed Termite to be less confusing
	If the space in front of them is empty they will dash forward one space and leave a rock

Changed Ice Crawler to be less confusing:
	Increased Damage is now removed: Core: 1 Unique: 2 Leader: 2
	Leader no longer has two directions, but still has ice explosion

Version 1.0.2

Fixed an issue with the Reactive Psion where you could move before it activated (for real this time).
Improved the delays on Reactive Psion to prevent corpse pushing.
Stoped the Antlion Leader to create cracks on timepods, intantly destroying them.
Stink clouds will no longer reappear if you create smoke on their place after their removal.
Fixed (hopefully) a Psion console error.
Fixed a bug where some exclusions wouldn't work

Balance Changes:
Fly added to the flying enemies exclusive table
Adjusted Termites target score to make them slightly less stupid.

Misc:
Ladybugs now can be added as normal enemies in easy edit and will properly target allies in normal missions.
Adds the DNT_LadybugException tag to except weapons from the ladybugs attacks.
Also included an option to add the tag to Wind Torrent.

Version 1.0.3 Hot Fix
Bug Fix: Fixed Mission Impossible so it worked with the v1.0.1 category swap

Version 1.0.4
Update customAnim lib to 1.0.2
Added a pawn check to the ladybug for getTargetArea's that don't have a pawn attached
Adds an option that allows you to add Vextra to the finale enemy and boss list. This is on by default.
	This is prompted by the change in easyEdit that allows the enemy and boss lists
	to automatically update if they haven't been edited. That means that if Vextra is
	on, and then a player turns it off, the game will now properly remove Vextra Vek
	from the finale lists, preventing errors. This assumes the player didn't update it
	themselves, but I assume that if they do, they have a good idea of how to use easyEdit
	Overall, it allows easy integration of Vextra into finale lists if desired
